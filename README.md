# drok
An AI discord bot, similar to twitters grok.<br>
This is still in a **VERY EARLY** stage! this only supports a very barebones amount of features so far, so dont try to put it on your discord server ( yet ;) ).<br>
The code is also verry messy, considering this is basically my first typescript project, and also my first AI-sdk project.

A hosted version is coming soon (if i remember about this project lol)

# Installation
Please note that this project probably will never explicitly support node, as bun is my runtime of choice.<br>
To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.2.20. [Bun](https://bun.com) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
